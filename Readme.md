# Chai Aur Backend
The complete solution of the assignment given by respected [@hiteshchoudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) in his free chai and backend course in the playlist.

It is one of the hardest course I have taken but the best part is the more hard the concept the easier the explanation of [Hitesh](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) sir ❤️.

Learned a lot more than most of other paid courses😎.


And the most important, writing the controllers without any help and then testing them skyrocketed my confidence🚀🚀🚀.


This repo is a way to show respect to [him](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary)🙏.
